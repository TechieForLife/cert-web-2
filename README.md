# Web Fundamentals 2: HTML/CSS

Create a website using plain html and css. You’ll be creating a personal website about yourself (If you’d rather do something else, just make sure to talk with the tech coach before hand). The purposes of this project are 1: demonstrate fundamental understanding of the building blocks of the web, without using a framework. 2: create a portfolio project you will be proud to show family, friends, future employers or potential clients. Below is a list of minimum requirements that each site must have in order to receive the html/css certificate. This list is just a starting point, you are encouraged to add many other elements and styles. Above all, I’ll be judging that time, energy and thought that went into this. Make it pretty. Make sure you use consistent fonts, colors and elements to make your site professional and visually appealing. 

* A word for the creatively impaired; I’d prefer it if you created something original, but if you need help with design, I don’t care if you rip off elements, colors, fonts or anything else from any other site as long as you don’t just copy paste the code into your own site. If you do borrow some designs, include a link to the site(s) with your project. I’m not so much worried about originality as I am about comprehension. Don’t copy paste something if you couldn’t modify it to suit your needs on the spot.
